<p> Seattle is one of the biggest cities in the state of Washington. It is best known for the Space Needle which is a big structure with a rotating cafe on top. And the view is unreal! Especially during the sunset.<p>
 <p> Here is a video of an overview of Seattle and a city guide for tourists.<p>
 <p> like I said the view is great from up there...
